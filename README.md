Lab1 - Find numbers in string with characters

Console application that takes a text string (argument) as an argument. The text string are then beeing searched for all substrings that are numbers that begin and ends in the same digit, without the start / end digit, or any other character other than numbers occur in between. ex. 3463, but 34363 is not because it exists another 3rd in the number, in addition to the start and final figure. Strings with letters in eg 95a9 is also not a correct number. Print and selecting each correct substring For each such substring that matches the above criterion, the program shall print one row with the entire string, but where the sub-string is highlighted in a different color.

The program also add together all the numbers it found and prints it out last in the program. Example output for input "29535123p48723487597645723645": Total = 5836428677242
